# Robot-SLAM-and-Path-Planning
Completed with partner Aidan Anderson for the USF Course Control of Mobile Robotics. Contains python scripts used to make the provided Raspberry Pi Robot perform tasks involving SLAM and Path Planning. task1.py has the robot traverse a maze's cells based on time spent moving and orientation, prioritizing unvisited cells and estimating position from camera data. task2.py has the robot traverse cells based on time spent moving and orientation, prioritizing unvisited cells and performing motion and measurement probability calculations based off of data from the robot's distance sensors and a map of the maze. task3.py has the robot traverse cells based on time spent moving and orientation, prioritizing unvisited cells and performing motion probability calculations based off of data from the robot's distance sensors to generate a map of its environment.
